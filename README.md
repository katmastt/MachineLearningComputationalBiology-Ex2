# MachineLearningComputationalBiology-Ex2

This was the second exercise of Machine Learning in Computational Biology course - MSc in Data Science and Information Technologies, Departement of Informatics and Telecommunications, National & Kapodistrian Uneversity of Athens.

# Datasets

On directory Assignment2_Datasets there are 5 csv files. Each one includes a different signle cell expression matrix.

# Implementation

On README.pdf you can find the complete report of the exercise.

Development of a data analysis pipeline for single-cell data processing. The pipeline includes dimensionality reduction (PCA, T-SNE, UMAP), clustering using GMM (different models were tested to find the best number of cell states - BIC criterion) and visualization of the resulted data (clusters and posterior probabilities). 

Note that the execution of this Jupyter Notebook would result in the creation of different figures on the same directoty.
